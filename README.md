From our data we come up with few conclusions:
First Conclusion: Male play and purchase more games than female.
Second Conclusion:Average females purchase is more than that of males
Third Conclusion: 
20-24 years old: highest rank (number of players)
15-19 years old: second rank (number of players)

Also, some popular items such as "Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" are not the most profitable items.
